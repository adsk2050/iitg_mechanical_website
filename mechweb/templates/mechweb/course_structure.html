    <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; font-size: 1.1em; text-align: center" >
            <i>The Bachelor's program in Mechanical Engineering Department is one of the oldest programs in IITG. 
               It started in year 1995, since then the undergraduate curriculum has been updated periodically 
               to make it relevant for the industrial needs and academic research works. The current curriculum 
               is diverse including the SA courses and the HSS courses. Students now can choose electives starting 
               from 6th semester and offers lot of flexibilty for those who want to pursue research  
               career instate-of-the-art field.

    <p style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; font-size: 1.1em; text-align: center" >
            <i>Aerodynamics and propulsion are probably the most important elements in aircraft design. Aerodynamics is mainly used to shape the aircraft so that it can fulfil all the mission requirements with minimum drag penalty. The aim of the propulsion system is to provide the required amount of thrust to the aircraft under all conditions. The understanding of aerodynamics is vital for the design of efficient, capable and competitive aircraft and the department offers core courses that gives the students a platform to explore the opportunities in this field. Core courses include Advanced Engineering Mathematics, Aircraft Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Gas Dynamics, Rocket Propulsion as compulsory. Also, students have to choose elective courses for each semester according to their interest. The past students of this specialization were placed in HAL, Fluidyn, Honda R&D, L&T etc.
